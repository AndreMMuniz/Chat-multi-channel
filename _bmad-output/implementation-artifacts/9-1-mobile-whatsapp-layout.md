# Story 9.1: Mobile — WhatsApp-style Navigation Layout

**Status:** ready-for-dev
**Epic:** 9 — Mobile Responsiveness
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** High
**Created:** 2026-05-02

## User Story

**As an agent,** I want the dashboard to work on mobile like WhatsApp — conversation list as Screen 1 and the chat as Screen 2 — so that I can handle support from my phone.

---

## Background & Context

**Current state:**
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` renders a fixed 3-column layout (sidebar + conversation list + chat area) with no mobile adaptation
- Only `frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx` is responsive — use it as a reference for Tailwind patterns
- Tailwind CSS is available; responsive prefixes (`md:`) are unused in the dashboard

**Architecture decision (from party mode roundtable 2026-05-02):**
- Use **URL-based routing** via Next.js App Router — not client-side state — so the browser Back button, deep linking, and Android back gesture all work natively
- `app/dashboard/` = conversation list (Screen 1)
- `app/dashboard/[conversationId]/` = chat area (Screen 2)
- On desktop (`md:`), both columns remain visible simultaneously (no regression)
- CSS-only show/hide (`hidden md:flex`): no JS viewport detection needed

**Design system:**
- Sidebar: `#1E2A3B` (always dark, collapses to icon-only or bottom-bar on mobile)
- Surface: `#FFFFFF`, Background: `#F8F9FA`
- Transition: `transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out` (Tailwind only — no Framer Motion)
- Back button icon: `ChevronLeft` from Lucide React, `md:hidden`

## Files to Create / Modify

| File | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `frontend/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` | **CREATE or UPDATE** | Add responsive wrapper; ConversationList `hidden md:flex`; `children` fills remaining space |
| `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` | **UPDATE** | Mobile: full-width conversation list; Desktop: unchanged |
| `frontend/src/app/dashboard/[conversationId]/page.tsx` | **CREATE** | Mobile: full-screen chat; Desktop: render as 3rd column inside layout |
| `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx` | **UPDATE** | Add `ChevronLeft` back button, `md:hidden` |

**Do NOT modify:** any backend file, any auth file, any admin page.

## Implementation Guide

### Mobile Layout Pattern

```tsx
// dashboard/layout.tsx
<div className="flex h-screen overflow-hidden">
  <Sidebar />  {/* always visible — collapses to icons on mobile */}
  
  {/* Conversation list: always visible on desktop; hidden on mobile when conversation is open */}
  <ConversationList className="w-full md:w-80 flex-shrink-0" />
  
  {/* Chat area: children (only rendered when /dashboard/[id] route is active) */}
  <main className="flex-1 hidden md:flex flex-col">
    {children}
  </main>
</div>
```

On mobile, navigation to `/dashboard/[id]` should make the list hidden and the chat visible. Use `usePathname()` to detect which screen is active.

### Back Button in ChatHeader

```tsx
// Visible only on mobile
<button
  onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}
  className="md:hidden flex items-center gap-1 text-slate-600 hover:text-slate-900 p-2"
>
  <ChevronLeft size={20} />
</button>
```

### Sidebar on Mobile

- On `< md`: sidebar collapses to a narrow icon-only strip OR hides entirely with a hamburger toggle
- On `md+`: sidebar renders normally with labels

### Transition Animation

Slide animation between screens uses Tailwind only:
```
Screen entering from right: translate-x-full → translate-x-0
Screen exiting to left: translate-x-0 → -translate-x-full
```

Apply via `data-state` attribute or conditional class on the route transition. Keep it simple — CSS transition, no library.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] On `< 768px`: only one column visible at a time (list OR chat)
- [ ] Selecting a conversation navigates to `/dashboard/[id]` and shows the chat full-screen
- [ ] Back button (`ChevronLeft`, `md:hidden`) in chat header navigates back to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Browser Back button / Android back gesture returns to conversation list
- [ ] Deep linking to `/dashboard/[id]` on mobile shows the chat with a functional back button
- [ ] On `md+` (768px+): 3-column desktop layout is pixel-identical to before — zero regression
- [ ] Sidebar adapts: icon-only or hidden on mobile, full labels on desktop
- [ ] Transition animation: slide-in from right when opening, slide-out to right when going back
- [ ] `safe-area-inset` padding applied so content is not hidden behind iPhone notch/home bar

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All files created/modified
- [ ] Layout renders correctly at 375px (iPhone SE), 390px (iPhone 14), 768px (tablet)
- [ ] Desktop layout at 1280px unchanged
- [ ] Browser back button tested on mobile viewport
- [ ] Deep link to specific conversation tested
- [ ] All existing Playwright tests pass (no regression)
